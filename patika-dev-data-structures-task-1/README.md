# Data Structures Task-1

My solution in Task-1. There are 2 different solutions. One of them uses JavaScript. The other one was written step by step to this file by me.

## 1) Insertion sort of [22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6]

```

//Step-1
    [2, 27, 16, 22, 18, 6]

//Step-2
    [2, 6, 16, 22, 18, 27]

//Step-3
    [2, 6, 16, 22, 18, 27]

//Step-4
    [2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27]

//Step-5, Step-6
    [2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27]

    Result => [2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27]
```

## 2) Big-O

```
    O(n^2)
```

## 3) Time Complexity

```
    Worst Case: O(n^2)
    Average Case: O(n^2)
    Best Case: O(n)

```

## 4) After sorting

```
   O(n)
```

## 5) Insertion sort of [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]

```
//Step-1
    [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]

//Step-2
    [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]

//Step-3
    [2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15,6]

//Step-4
    [2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6]

//Step-5
    [2,3,4,5,6,9,8,15,7]

//Step-6
    [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,15,9]

//Step-7
    [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,15,9]

//Step-8
    [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,15]

//Step-9
    [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,15]

    Result => [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,15]

```
